These are some simple scripts I used to organize a collect of many thousands of
photographs into a coherent directory hierarchy base on year/month/day (yyyy/mm/dd):

```
2021/
  01/
    img_0000.jpg
  02/
    01/
      img_0002.jpg
    04/
      img_0003.jpg
    22/
      img_0004.jpg
      img_0005.jpg
      img_0006.jpg
    24/
      img_0007.jpg
  03/
  (etc)
```

WARNING:
**None of these scripts deletes any file, but they create scripts that you can run to copy/move/delete files.**

### You should make sure you have backups of your pictures before running any of these scripts, I waive any responsibility if you delete irreplaceable files!!!
